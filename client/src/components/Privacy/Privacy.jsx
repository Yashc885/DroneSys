    <p class="mb-2 py-2">
      We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Platforms, and about your use of the Services, even if you access the Platforms or use the Services without registering or logging in.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">

This may include, for example, photographs, audio and video clips, personal contacts, and address book information.</li>
      <li><strong>Location information:</strong> Our applications collect real-time information about the location of your device, as permitted by you. When you use one of our location-enabled services (for example, when you access the Platforms from a mobile device), we may collect and process information about your mobile device’s GPS location (including the latitude, longitude, or altitude of your mobile device) and the time the location information is recorded to customize the Services with location-based information and features (for example, to inform you about alumni events in your area). Some of these services require your personal data for the feature to work and we may associate location data with your device ID and other information we hold about you. We keep this data for no longer than is reasonably necessary for providing services to you. If you wish to use the particular feature, you will be asked to consent to your data being used for this purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disabling the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this.</li>

      <li><strong>Mobile device IDs:</strong> Unique mobile device identifier (e.g. IDFA or other device IDs on Apple devices like the iPhone and iPad), if you are using our Services on a mobile device, we may use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We may do this to store your preferences and track your use of our applications. Unlike cookies, mobile device IDs cannot be deleted. Advertising companies may use device IDs to track your use of our applications, track the number of advertisements displayed, measure advertising performance, and display advertisements that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies may use mobile device IDs to measure how frequently you use our applications, track application usage, and obtain other information regarding your use of our applications. Mobile device IDs can only be used to track users across applications within the same mobile platform (e.g., iOS applications or Android applications). They cannot be used to track users across different mobile platforms (e.g., Android applications and iOS applications).</li>

    <h2 class="py-4 md:py-6 text-red-500 font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl">9. Security: How We Protect Your Information</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to your Information and to maintain data security. These safeguards take into account the sensitivity of the Information that we collect, process and store and the current state of technology. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it, including the use of vault and tokenization services from Third Party service providers. The Third-Party service providers with respect to our vault and tokenization services and also our payment gateway and payment processing are all validated as compliant with the payment card industry standard (generally referred to as PCI compliant service providers). However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and thereby usage in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      We assume no liability or responsibility for disclosure of your Information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized Third-Party access, or other causes beyond our control.

If we receive instructions using your user name and password, we will consider that you have authorized such instructions. Further, notwithstanding anything contained in this Privacy Policy or elsewhere, we shall not be held responsible for any loss, damage or misuse of your Information, if such loss, damage or misuse is attributable to any event that is beyond our reasonable control.
